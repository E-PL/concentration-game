## Debugging

In the game variable are stored all game methods and properties.
You can access them in your javascript console like this:

	game.win()		<- will open the victory modal

## Credits

Forked from the Udacity starter code repository https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game 

I have used a timer function from http://jsfiddle.net/fc37nckg/

and a shuffle function from: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976

The game uses Font Awesome and the Google Coda font,

the animations are realized using Animate.css: https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/
